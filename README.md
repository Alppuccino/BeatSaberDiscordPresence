# Installation
*This plugin requires IPA which you will automatically get if you install [the Song Loader Plugin](https://github.com/xyonico/BeatSaberSongInjector/releases).*

1. Make sure that Beat Saber is not running.
2. Extract the contents of the zip into Beat Saber's installation folder.
	For Oculus Home: `\Oculus Apps\Software\hyperbolic-magnetism-beat-saber\`
	For Steam: `\steamapps\common\Beat Saber\`
		(The folder that contains Beat Saber.exe)
4. Done! You've installed the Discord Presence Plugin.

# Building the project yourself
I haven't included the discord-rpc.dll that is required in source, so you need to get it yourself here: https://github.com/discordapp/discord-rpc/releases
